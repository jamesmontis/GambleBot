// GambleBot is in javascript/Node, it uses a discord.js dependency

Goals of this early on are to add casino games like blackjack, roulette, other stuff.

Blackjack would return card emojis like red 13 diamond, but with images (text early on)

Play the game by typing '=bj <betAmount>', '=balance'

hit,stay, double are possible choices, maybe split later on

Bot updates users accounts with money, currently it only stores while bot is on, a long term solution to keep 24/7 memory needs to be solved

Users with $0 can beg or work for money, various tasks can be assigned to ridicule the users.

=cheat is an option but can result in being "thrown out" and any profit taken from user.
or
they can successfully cheat, and each cheat attempt rolls a slight chance to get better at cheating over time (will need to be capped)
